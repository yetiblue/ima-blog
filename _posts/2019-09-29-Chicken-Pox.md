Pretty circles
---


Honestly at the start I had no idea what I wanted to create. I was considering something along the lines of a cool layout of manhatten and having the string of circles navigate the streets, but then I saw that Bailey already did a maze so I went and figured out what other thing I could make. 

So then I thought about what kind of cool things circles could make and I had this sudden idea of drawing a bunch of different sized circles across the canvas. 

Luckily after a bit of searching online I came across Dan Shiffman's tutorial on how to make a bunch of circles that wouldn't overlap. Though I knew the code would be available to just download, I followed the tutorial to understand the logic of the code and typed it along as he created the program so I could get a sense of the syntax and understand how to do each part. Some of the sections I didn't quite get what the code was trying to do so I looked it up seperately. 

The first was figuring out what the syntax for 'for loops' meant. The section is the value set before the loop runs, the second section is the condition that needs to be met, and the [variable]++ essentially means run again

The code for making sure the circles don't overlap was really interesting when Dan explained the logic behind how this line would work. Basically if the distance from midpoint to midpoint was less than the two radii then the circle would overlap and be no good.

The '!' in front of a variable wasn't something I'd seen before but a little big of searching revealed that it's just a simple function that says if *not* true for the value of a variable *then* do something.

Here I learned that arrays can be used and called upon when defining the dimensions of a circle, and that the width and height of an ellipse is read as diamter by js and so radius needs to be multiplied by 2

After I was done watching the tutorial I went ahead and customized the color each circle with (random(0,255)) instead of sticking with the pink that Dan decided on.

Here's the final results:
