My Idea for this final was conceived at the start of the semester when I was randomly browsing through public sculptures online. This Plastic monster was really cool in the sense that it definitely created the desired effect and served a bigger purpose than just looking cool. 

Here it is:

At the time we had just begun working with Physical Computing so I'd heard about the various sensors that are available and the idea of having the statue "turning on" when someone looked at it or came too close came to mind. When it came online it would yell at people angrily for creating so much trash. I'd originally planned to build something around the size of my inspiration during Winter break or something. 

When thinking of Ideas for my final, I added this idea to the end of list because at that point we've learned a lot more in class and I had ideas for other projects too that used concepts like Machine learning. Gabriella convince me to stay with the statue, however, because it was the only one of my projects that included a message bigger than itself, so I decided to go along with it. 

The first day, I couldn't focus on the code side of things so I procrastinated by figuring out how exactly I was going to put all these sushi containers together. A couple hours later of trying to fight gravity with no glue, I came up with a concept that I liked and decided to finish protyping it by quickly drawing what was missing.
