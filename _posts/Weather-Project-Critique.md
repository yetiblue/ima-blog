What struck me the most in the Weather Project by Olafur Eliasson, was the sense of environment he managed to foster. It’s a bit hard to explain, but the combination of the aesthetics that are found during a sunset and a futuristic sci-fi like room really captivated me. The circle almost could also be something completely different than the sun, the photographs with the silhouettes behind the railing remind me of the trans-dimensional portal scene in The Man in the High Castle. The colors in the room are warm and really soothing, while the brightness of the light seems like they could be slowly pulling you in is the feeling I get overall. 

An aspect that the project does super well is making it super accessible to everyone. There’s no need for instructions, you just go in and enjoy it however you want - sort of like a public park. Because it’s so ambiguous in nature, there’s no right or wrong way to enjoy it as seen in the photos; some people are standing up and looking up or are the sun while others are simply lying down and enjoying the views of themselves on the ceiling. I love the fact that Olafur made the design choice to include this in a long and narrow room. This way, the audience sees the focal point, which is the sun, from afar and is immediately compelled to make the journey across to the other side of the room. The concrete walls and floor complete the cyberpunk/dystopian look, reminding me of buildings built in China and Russia during the soviet era. The grey color is really cold and stark compared to the light emitted by the sun disk which when put in contrast with one another works very well. I also thought that putting mirrors on the ceiling was a nice touch since it expanded the exhibit to another dimension of the space and helped to fill it more. This way people who are laying down have something to look at, much like how people try to figure out what a specific cloud looks like. 

I believe that this piece could be made even better if the same space and the disk could be utilized for another scene or two. Once someone gets past the initial amazement over the environment and design there’s nothing really more to see that would surprise them. The space and everything is already there for perhaps a night scene. The sun could easily transform into the moon, and the floor could be utilized along with projectors to display a peaceful river.
