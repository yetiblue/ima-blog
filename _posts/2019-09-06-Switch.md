My idea for this project was the make a wire sculpture of a fencer lunging at a wall target (breadboard). The tip of the weapon would go into the hole that the switch would typically go into which would complete the circuit and turn on the light. THe light would be on the head because at international competitions they have mask lights as well and because I would have an excuse to solder. 

First I built the legs and got it to stand on its own.

Then I built the entire sculpture and called it a day after writing down what would need to be soldered into place so I wouldn't need to use tape....

First thing today I attempt to attatch the arm with solder and instead manage to burn through the frame... twice

Off camera I quickly rebuilt the frame and actually figured out how I'm going to make this work because I realized I didn't actually think how I would make wires connect everywhere properly. I just had a vague idea of metal sculpture + some wires mixed in + point hits breadboard = light on!

The next step would be to solder wires to the led, because in order for it to reach the breadboard and sit on top of the guy's head I would need longer wires.

After that, I wanted to solder the wire that was going to act as a switch to the guys weapon but that didn't go so well, so tape to the rescue!

(tape basically replaced everything I wanted to originally solder onto the frame :/)

Now that everything was haphazardly connected, I realized that my wires connecting back to the breadboard were way too long and the sculpture would never be able to reach it, so I cut them down a bit.

Now that I could reach the board and turn the light on, I saw that the breadboard was being pushed back whenever I pushed against the wires, so, you guessed it... more tape.

Here's the final result!
