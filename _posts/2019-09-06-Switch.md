My idea for this project was the make a wire sculpture of a fencer lunging at a wall target (breadboard). The tip of the weapon would go into the hole that the switch would typically go into which would complete the circuit and turn on the light. THe light would be on the head because at international competitions they have mask lights as well and because I would have an excuse to solder. 

First I built the legs and got it to stand on its own. 

Then I built the entire sculpture and called it a day after writing down what would need to be soldered into place so I wouldn't need to use tape....

First thing today I attempt to attatch the arm with solder and instead manage to burn through the frame... twice

Off camera I quickly rebuild the frame and actually figure out how I'm going to make this work because I realized I didn't actually think how I would make wires connect everywhere properly. I just had a vague idea of metal sculpture + some wires mixed in + point hits breadboard = light on!
