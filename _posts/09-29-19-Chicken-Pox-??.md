Honestly at the start I had no idea what I wanted to create. I was considering something along the lines of a cool layout of manhatten and having the string of circles navigate the streets, but then I saw that Bailey already did a maze so I went and figured out what other thing I could make. 

So then I thought about what kind of cool things circles could make and I had this sudden idea of drawing a bunch of different sized circles across the canvas. 

Luckily after a bit of searching online I came across Dan Shiffman's tutorial on how to make a bunch of circles that wouldn't overlap. Though I knew the code would be available to just download, I followed the tutorial to understand the logic of the code and typed it along as he created the program so I could get a sense of the syntax and understand how to do each part. Some of the sections I didn't quite get what the code was trying to do so I looked it up seperately. 

After I was done watching the tutorial I went ahead and customized the color each circle with (random(0,255)) instead of sticking with the pink that Dan decided on. 

Here's the final results:
