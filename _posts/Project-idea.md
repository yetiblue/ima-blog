1. the first of three ideas was inspired by a piece called Indirect Flights, by Joe Hamilton. He created a movable page composed of stitched together aerial photos from google maps. He also included images of chain fences and doorways that opened up to the bird eye view scenary. There's been a couple of projects that we've seen already that utilizes maps in some way, so I thought it'd be cool to see if we can do anything with that as well, specifically with a focus on security and borders etc.
2. The second idea revolves around Zoom. Maybe just a simple display revolving around being able to randomly control a student in the grid view for a meeting. 
3. My third idea was to use p5 to take "portraits" of people, but it would be really low resolution or some other type of filter applied over the person. Then I'd take a collection of those photos and put them up on display and have people try and figure out who's who. Private vs semi-private. Kind of like that leaked linked password thing, people's images are in plainview but it's still hard to pinpoint who they are exactly. 

As a group we decided to expand upon the second idea. We'll build a teacher's view of zoom with button controls that allow the teacher to turn on a student's video or audio, spy on private chats, and troll students with random audio distortions.
