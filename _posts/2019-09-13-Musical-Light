Pulled up a video of Beethoven's fifth and decided to do 30 secs of the first momvement. Going to time each note to the closest millisecond and then put it into the code
Used the lap feature on my phone timer for each note to get the delay 
(figuring out how to time when the switch is presed and when the music starts)
figure out which notes are for the red LED and how to connect it. 

My project idea initially started out with a basic vision for multiple lights that would somehow blink after one another or in some sort of organized sequence.
