At first I wanted to do something completely different like displaying the population of vegetarians in the world. The challenges I came across there involved actually finding a data file with that information (I found a table on wikipedia and then looked up a super confusing video of someone messing with API's to convert into JSON but that was way over my head). The other issue was how I would actually try and make that a visual besides just a boring graph. 
Eventually I gave up and decided to follow Dan's video on how to map earthquake data and then tried to figure out how the code works.
